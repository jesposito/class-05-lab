# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

Tonight you'll be polishing and deploying your Guessing Game to GitHub Pages.

### General Workflow for this Assignment

Today in lab you will create a new GitHub repo and complete some little code problems.

**Be sure to follow instructions carefully.**

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and efficient app-switching processes.
* Create a new branch for each code problem and merge each branch into *master* when the problem is completed. Do the problems in order. Don't forget to pull the new master branch from GitHub into your local master branch each time, before creating the branch for the next problem.

### Create, fork, and clone a new GitHub repo named class-05-lab

1. Create the repo
2. Clone the repo
3. Create a new branch called `class-5-lab`
4. Copy/Paste starter code from this directory
5. Work on the code problems specified in comments of `app.js`
6. acp
7. Make Pull Request (PR)

### HTML and JS setup
You are being given starter code for today in the index.html and app.js files inside of this directory.

Submission instructions are in the Canvas assignment.

### Deployment of Guessing Game

We'll be deploying our finished About Me projects to GitHub Pages. Feel free to work on this with your classmates or by yourself. This will make them real, live websites that people can visit. The process is simple:

- Finish all technical requirements and any other tweaks you want to make.
- Add-commit-push your working branch.
- Create a PR on GitHub and merge your final changes to the master branch.
- Pull master in your terminal so you have the final product saved to your local master branch.
- Checkout a new `gh-pages` branch. It must have the exact name `gh-pages`
- To deploy your site, add-commit-push the `gh-pages` branch to GH.
- Verify that deployment was successful: go to your repo on GitHub and open the settings tab. Look for the GitHub Pages section, where you should see a message saying `Your site is published at http://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>` Follow that link and play through your game. Everything should be working correctly. If some part of your deployed page doesn't work, look for console messages or other errors, or consult an instructor.
